# Statistics
Facts are stubborn things, but statistics are pliable.

Additional Notes:

Probability Density Function:
- In all measurements of bodily features or innate natural abilities in the entirety of the human population or any animal or plat population, the distribution of that variable would be a normal distribution.
- It is also common in measurements of mass-produced items.
- Mean - M and Std. deviation - S;
  - M-S and M+S have around 68%(34% each) of the population
  - M-2S and M+2S have 27%(13.5% each) of the population
  - M-3S and M+3S have 5% of the population
